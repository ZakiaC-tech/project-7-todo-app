# Simple Todo App

The Simple Todo App is a web application that allows users to create, manage, and track their daily tasks. Users can add new to-do items, mark them as completed, and delete them as needed, all through a clean and intuitive interface.

## Functionality

The application renders an initial list of to-do items using JavaScript. Users can:

- Open and close a modal form to add new to-do items
- Create a new to-do by submitting the form or pressing Enter
- Assign an optional due date to each to-do
- Mark to-do items as completed or uncompleted
- Delete existing to-do items
- See unique checkbox/label associations generated for each item

Form validation ensures that required fields are filled out correctly before submission, improving usability and preventing errors.
